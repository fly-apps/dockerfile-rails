# The FUSE section handles settings on the FUSE file system. FUSE
# provides a layer for intercepting SQLite transactions on the
# primary node so they can be shipped to replica nodes transparently.
fuse:
  # Required. This is the mount directory that applications will
  # use to access their SQLite databases.
  dir: "/litefs"

  # Set this flag to true to allow non-root users to access mount.
  # You must set the "user_allow_other" option in /etc/fuse.conf first.
  allow-other: false

  # The debug flag enables debug logging of all FUSE API calls.
  # This will produce a lot of logging. Not for general use.
  debug: false

# The data section specifies where internal LiteFS data is stored
# and how long to retain the transaction files.
# 
# Transaction files are used to ship changes to replica nodes so
# they should persist long enough for replicas to retrieve them,
# even in the face of a short network interruption or a redeploy.
# Under high load, these files can grow large so it's not advised
# to extend retention too long.
data:
  # Path to internal data storage.

  retention: "10m"

  # Frequency with which to check for LTX files to delete.

# If true, then LiteFS will not wait until the node becomes the
# primary or connects to the primary before starting the subprocess.

# If true, then LiteFS will not exit if there is a validation
# issue on startup. This can be useful for debugging issues as
# it avoids constantly restarting the node on ephemeral hosting.

# This section defines settings for the LiteFS HTTP API server.
# This API server is how nodes communicate with each other.
http:
  # Specifies the bind address of the HTTP API server.
  addr: ":20202"

# This section defines settings for the option HTTP proxy.
# This proxy can handle primary forwarding & replica consistency
# for applications that use a single SQLite database.
proxy:
  # Specifies the bind address of the proxy server.
  addr: ":3000"

  # The hostport of the target application.
  target: "localhost:3001"

# The lease section defines how LiteFS creates a cluster and
# implements leader election. For dynamic clusters, use the
# "consul". This allows the primary to change automatically when
# the current primary goes down. For a simpler setup, use
# "static" which assigns a single node to be the primary and does
# not failover.
lease:
  promote: true

  # Required. Must be either "consul" or "static".
  type: "consul"

  # Required. The URL for this node's LiteFS API.
  # Should match HTTP port.
  advertise-url: "http://${HOSTNAME}.vm.${FLY_APP_NAME}.internal:20202"

  # Specifies whether the node can become the primary. If using
  # "static" leasing, this should be set to true on the primary
  # and false on the replicas.
  candidate: ${FLY_REGION == PRIMARY_REGION}

  # A Consul server provides leader election and ensures that the
  # responsibility of the primary node can be moved in the event
  # of a deployment or a failure.
  consul:
    # Required. The base URL of the Consul server.

    key: "litefs/${FLY_APP_NAME}"

    # Length of time before a lease expires. The primary will
    # automatically renew the lease while it is alive, however,
    # if it fails to renew in time then a new primary may be
    # elected after the TTL. This only occurs for unexpected loss
    # of the leader as normal operation will allow the leader to
    # handoff the lease to another replica without downtime.
    #
    # Consul does not allow a TTL of less than 10 seconds.
    ttl: "10s"

    # Length of time after the lease expires before a candidate
